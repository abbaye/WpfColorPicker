# Wpf ColorPicker controls

## ðŸŽ¯ ATTENTION : BUILD WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2019 v16.3.7+

Wpf ColorPicker is a set of customs usercontrol that can take color in your app. 

Forked base from an old 2006 Microsoft sample project. I have adapted the code to be more actual and I will add somes other new colors picker from me.

I will add localisation, new features and controls like colorpicker combobox...
